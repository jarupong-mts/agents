# Portable Artifact Contracts

These are logical contracts. Adapters may represent them as JSON, YAML, Markdown,
or native tool results, but the fields and meaning should remain compatible.

Apply the [record-boundary policy](../SPEC.md#documentation-knowledge-and-run-artifacts)
when describing project documentation, durable knowledge, and run artifacts.
Record scope-relevant purpose, canonical home, owner, approved destination and
write limits in existing inventory, mapping, scope, evidence, and result/outcome
records or adapter-native equivalents. This adds no mandatory artifact fields or
ADR inventory. Classification follows purpose and authority, not folder names;
ordinary project documents do not inherit knowledge metadata from topic or location.

## Evidence Record

Evidence records use the same fields in discovery, concept/file mapping, and
native post-write verification. Exactly one of `source_url` or `source_path`
must identify the source; `source_path` is an exact host or first-party source
path, not an inferred or illustrative path. `verification_evidence_ref` points
to the exact command, native diagnostic, effective-configuration view,
registration/API result, session/delegation check, or evidence record used for
verification.

```yaml
evidence_id: evidence-123
status: verified              # verified | unknown | blocked
source_url: https://first-party.example/docs/native-conventions
source_path: null             # use instead of source_url when a URL is not applicable
accessed_date: YYYY-MM-DD
applicable_platform_version: "release-or-channel"
applicable_operating_mode: local
finding: "The host recognizes the native mechanism"
confidence: high              # high | medium | low
exact_native_destination: "exact verified destination or null"
mechanism: "exact load, invoke, enforce, or verification mechanism"
verification_evidence_ref: "exact command, source, or evidence reference"
```

`source_url` and `source_path` are mutually exclusive and one is required.
`applicable_platform_version`, `applicable_operating_mode`, `finding`, and
`confidence` are required for every material finding. Low-confidence, stale, or
contradictory evidence has `status: unknown` or `status: blocked` and cannot
authorize a mapping or write.

## Native Discovery

Native Convention Discovery is a read-only prerequisite for concept mapping,
file-map proposals, and writes. It records the actual host and target
inventory, rather than prescribing a platform layout. A discovery has status
`verified` only when the relevant evidence and destinations are verified;
`unknown` records an unresolved convention, and `blocked` records a condition
that requires stopping before a write.

```yaml
discovery_id: discovery-123
run_id: run-123
status: unknown              # verified | unknown | blocked
platform: codex
platform_version: "release-or-channel"

    source_path: null      # exact first-party path when a URL is not applicable
    accessed_date: YYYY-MM-DD
    applicable_platform_version: "release-or-channel"
    applicable_operating_mode: local
    finding: "The host loads the verified native mechanism"
    confidence: high       # high | medium | low
    verification_evidence_ref: source-1
capability_destinations:
  - capability: main_agent_bootstrap
    status: verified       # verified | unknown | blocked
    exact_native_destination: "exact verified destination"
    mechanism: "exact load, invoke, or enforcement mechanism"
    verification_evidence_ref: source-1
    evidence_refs: [source-1]
  - capability: write_files
    status: unknown
    exact_native_destination: null
    mechanism: null
    verification_evidence_ref: null
    evidence_refs: []
    unknown_blocker_reason: "The host convention could not be established"
unknown_blocker_reasons:
  - capability: write_files
    status: unknown       # unknown | blocked
    reason: "Missing or contradictory first-party evidence"
    required_action: "Ask for the missing information or report the run blocked"
```

Each `first_party_sources` record must contain `status`, exactly one of
`source_url` or `source_path`, `accessed_date`,
`applicable_platform_version`, `applicable_operating_mode`, `finding`, and
`confidence`, and `verification_evidence_ref`. Each material finding must
reference current, mutually consistent first-party evidence. Each capability
that is reused or translated must have a verified `exact_native_destination`,
`mechanism`, and
`verification_evidence_ref`. Every destination has its own `status`; discovery
is `verified` only when all relevant destinations and their evidence are
verified. Unknown, unsupported, stale, contradictory, or low-confidence
evidence must be `unknown` or `blocked` and must not be promoted into a file
map. Unknown destinations cannot be guessed. Illustrative paths such as
`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` are not evidence
of a native convention. Native verification is required after an approved write;
file existence alone is insufficient, and the result belongs in the Run Summary.
This contract does not create platform config files or hardcode a universal
native layout.

`target_layout` is required for an application that writes files. The preview
must show the target-native destinations before approval. `source_tree_reproduction`
must be `false`, and `unapproved_source_tree_paths` must be empty, before the
application may proceed. A value of `true` or `unknown` blocks approval and target
writes; an existing target path may be retained only when the inventory and map
give it an independent reason.

Use the existing inventory fields and evidence findings to record the selected
scope's relevant project-documentation, knowledge, and run homes and ownership.
Reuse a home only when its discovered or approved purpose and ownership fit the
record; a general documentation area is not an implicit learning or run home.
Carry the supported placement and permission decisions into the applicable
Concept Map and Target File Map entries. Unresolved destinations remain explicit
gaps, never invented paths.

## Concept Map

The Concept Map preserves the portable concept while recording how the actual
host supports it. Every covered concept has exactly one action: `reuse`,
`translate`, `reference`, or `omit`. `reuse` and `translate` require a verified
exact native destination, mechanism, and linked discovery evidence.

```yaml
concept_map_id: concept-map-123
discovery_id: discovery-123
status: unknown               # verified | unknown | blocked; an unknown entry is illustrative
skill_materializations:
  - skill: context-engineering
    selection_status: materialized # materialized | reused_existing | omitted | unsupported
    materialization_source:

      status: compatible           # compatible | adapted | incompatible | not_applicable
      precedence_contracts: [lifecycle, approval, roles, no_commit, concurrency, artifact_contracts]
      decisions: []
    supporting_assets:
      required: []                # records use {path, purpose}
      included: []                # records use {path, destination}
      omitted: []                 # each omission requires {path, reason}
    fallback:
      used: false

    action: translate          # reuse | translate | reference | omit
    status: verified           # per-destination status
    source_material_refs: [portable-source-1]
    exact_native_destination: "target-native bootstrap or session mechanism"
    mechanism: "host mechanism that loads or invokes the concept"
    discovery_evidence_refs: [source-1]
    verification_evidence_ref: source-1
    omission_reason: null
  - concept: unsupported_capability
    action: omit
    status: unknown
    source_material_refs: [portable-source-2]
    exact_native_destination: null
    mechanism: null
    discovery_evidence_refs: [source-2]
    verification_evidence_ref: null
    omission_reason: "The host does not expose the required capability"
  - concept: source_workflow
    action: reference
    status: verified
    source_material_refs: [portable-source-1]
    exact_native_destination: null
    mechanism: null
    discovery_evidence_refs: []
    verification_evidence_ref: null
    omission_reason: null
```

Each application artifact records one `skill_materializations` item for each
selected or explicitly omitted skill. A `materialized` or `reused_existing`
skill has exactly one `materialization_source`; never materialize both a local
definition and an upstream candidate for the same skill. Resolve and record the
source's full commit SHA and `accessed_date` at application time. Candidate
branches such as `main` are mutable references, not locks; do not carry a
research-time SHA forward as the application's source pin. If an upstream body
must be changed to meet harness compatibility rules, use `kind: local_adaptation`
and record the upstream influence under `adapted_from` rather than calling it a
direct upstream materialization.

`supporting_assets.required` lists non-skill files needed by the selected source;
`included` records those actually materialized, and each `omitted` asset needs
an exact path and reason. `fallback.used` is true only when the preferred source
was unavailable or incompatible and a different single source was selected;
record both sources and the reason. If no skill source is materialized, use an
applicable `selection_status`, set `materialization_source: null`, and set
`omission.omitted: true` with a reason. Never report a silent fallback or
omission.

An `omit` entry must include `omission_reason`. A `reference` entry points to
source material without creating a target destination; `source_material_refs`
are not native evidence refs and do not establish host support. A concept map with
`unknown` or `blocked` status cannot authorize approval to proceed or any target
write.

## Target File Map

The Target File Map is the approved, target-specific projection of the Concept
Map. It is created only after verified discovery and explicit user approval.

```yaml
file_map_id: file-map-123
concept_map_id: concept-map-123
status: unknown               # verified | unknown | blocked; an unknown entry is illustrative
layout_audit:
  status: unknown              # verified | unknown | blocked
  native_projection_preview: []
  source_tree_reproduction: unknown
  unapproved_source_tree_paths: []
  verification_evidence_ref: null
entries:
  - file_map_entry_id: file-1
    concept: workflow_lifecycle
    action: translate          # reuse | translate | reference | omit
    status: verified           # per-destination status
    source_material_refs: [portable-source-1]
    exact_native_destination: "exact target file, setting, API, or session"
    mechanism: "exact native load, invoke, or enforcement mechanism"
    discovery_evidence_refs: [source-1]
    verification_evidence_ref: source-1
    omission_reason: null
  - file_map_entry_id: file-2
    concept: unsupported_capability
    action: omit
    status: unknown
    source_material_refs: [portable-source-2]
    exact_native_destination: null
    mechanism: null
    discovery_evidence_refs: [source-2]
    verification_evidence_ref: null
    omission_reason: "No verified native destination exists"
```

Every `reuse` or `translate` entry must identify the exact destination and
mechanism and link to discovery evidence. Every `reference` or `omit` entry
must not invent a destination; every `omit` entry must state its reason. Each
entry has a per-destination `status`, using only `verified`, `unknown`, or
`blocked`.

`layout_audit.status` may be `verified` only when the preview is target-native,
`source_tree_reproduction` is `false`, and no unapproved source-tree path is
listed. A missing, failed, or unknown layout audit forbids approval with
`decision: proceed` and forbids target writes.

Unknown or blocked discovery, mapping, or file-map entries forbid approval with
`decision: proceed` and forbid target writes. Stale, contradictory, or
low-confidence evidence is not a valid basis for a verified entry.

`executor` names the Builder for the slice and is required on every Plan slice. Use
`ui-implementer` only when the slice's write scope is primarily frontend/UI
(redesigns, dashboards, layouts, components, styling, responsive interfaces) and
`implementer` for backend and general coding. A slice that needs both substantial
UI and backend work must be split into separate slices with a dependency, one
executor each; a small backend change that the approved criteria require inside a
UI slice may stay with `ui-implementer` and must be named in the slice's `files`.
The Main Agent delegates the slice to its approved executor only; changing it
requires renewed Plan approval. A Builder's Task Result `agent` must equal the
slice's `executor`; a mismatch or missing value is an invalid result to be
returned to the Main Agent, not accepted as `implementer` by default.

`depends_on` defines slice readiness: a task with no dependencies is ready when
the full Plan is approved, and a task with dependencies is ready only after all
listed tasks complete. Every slice explicitly declares `test_subtask.action`.
For `create` or `extend`, that slice's Builder always waits for completed Test
Engineering and its delivered handoff, regardless of disjoint test/production
files or claimed independence from test output. The handoff identifies its
approved slice, role, scope, changed test paths, acceptance-criteria coverage,
and execution results or an explicit not-run statement. Failed, blocked, or
incomplete test authoring does not release the Builder. Completed authoring
may include expected red tests for missing behavior; passing tests are not a
prerequisite for implementation. `action: none` adds no Test Engineer stage;
ordinary approved dependencies and conflict checks still apply.

`parallel_eligible` permits overlap only for Test Engineer and Implementer
invocations from different slices after approval, readiness, and a recorded
independence assessment in `conflict_checks` or an adapter-native equivalent.
Assess approved scopes, read/write file use, shared helpers, fixtures/databases,
resources, mutable state, and ordering. `files` covers the complete scheduled
file scope, including `test_subtask.file` and files observed by tests/checks;
`read_files` and `write_files` distinguish their uses. Record evidence that each
proposed concurrent pair is independent, including whether tests/checks may
observe another slice's unfinished changes in the default `in_place_uncommitted`
shared worktree. Task IDs, separate outputs, or disjoint write paths alone do
not establish independence. When independence/conflicts are unknown or a conflict
exists, serialize affected invocations and record the reason in
`serialization_reasons` or equivalent existing run state. Proven independent
slices may overlap without requiring worktrees. The example's declared
dependencies serialize its slices; `parallel_eligible: true` alone grants no
overlap.

Keep every invocation and result attributable to its approved slice, role,
scope, and handoff; concurrency never combines acceptance criteria or
responsibility. Verifier, Reviewer, Knowledge Curator, and other specialists
never overlap active specialist work; verification follows all test/build work,
then review and curation run serially. These fields describe the contract and do
not implement a scheduler.

For record changes, use existing task files, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and
scope prose to state purpose, canonical home, owner, and approved writes. Link
relevant canonical documents and evidence for duplicate/contradiction checks;
keep normative requirements distinct from learned evidence. Task Results and
Knowledge Outcomes report actual scoped changes and unresolved issues through
their existing summary, evidence, concerns, reason, and remaining-work records as
applicable. Curation does not grant general project-documentation write permission.

## Task Result

```yaml
task_id: slice-1
role: implementer       # test_engineer | implementer (UI Implementer also uses implementer)
agent: implementer      # required for Builder results: implementer | ui-implementer; must equal the slice's approved executor; null for test_engineer
approved_scope: "src/auth/state.ts; five-minute expiry and single-use state"
test_handoff_ref: "slice-1/test_engineer/attempt-1" # logical result reference; null for action none
status: completed       # completed | failed | blocked | needs-replan
attempt: 1
retry:
  is_retry: false
  retry_of_attempt: null
  reason: null
recovery_state: pass     # pass | retry_implementer | replan | escalate | user_input
files_changed:
  - src/auth/state.ts
tests_run:
  - tests/auth/state.test.ts
summary: "Added expiring, single-use server-side state storage"
concerns: []
root_cause: null
```

Use this Task Result contract for Test Engineer handoffs as well as Builder
results, or an adapter-native equivalent preserving the same attribution.
`task_id`, `role`, and `approved_scope` identify the invocation; do not merge
criteria or responsibility across slices. A Test Engineer's `status` describes
authoring completion separately from test success. Its handoff uses
`files_changed` for changed test paths, `summary` for the acceptance-criteria
coverage, and `tests_run` for execution results or an explicit not-run statement.
Expected red tests for missing behavior may accompany `status: completed`;
failed, blocked, or incomplete authoring cannot release the same slice's Builder.
The Main Agent must deliver the completed result to the Builder before it starts.
A Builder's `test_handoff_ref` identifies that exact delivered result. A Test
Engineer sets this reference to `null` for its own outgoing handoff. For
`action: none`, the Builder sets it to `null` and explains the absence of a Test
Engineer stage in `summary`; approved dependencies/conflicts still apply.

`failure_classification` describes the observed failure. `replan_only_on` in the
Plan execution policy describes routing triggers; it is not another failure
classification. When a failure maps to a re-plan trigger, Verification Result
may include the optional `replan_trigger` field. Use `permission_failure` →
`permission_invalidation`, `platform_failure` → `platform_invalidation`, and a
criteria conflict → `acceptance_criteria_change`. `replan_trigger` is otherwise
`null` and may contain only one of the trigger names listed in its schema comment.

## Review Result

```yaml
status: approved        # approved | changes-requested | blocked
findings:
  - severity: medium
    title: "Missing concurrent callback test"
    file: tests/auth/callback.test.ts
    recommendation: "Add a test for duplicate callback submission"
```

## Knowledge Outcome

The full workflow requires a post-review Knowledge Curator assessment on every
run, without separate per-run opt-in. This contract also applies to independent
partial adoption of knowledge management, without requiring agents, models, or
run-state storage. Partial scopes without knowledge report `outside_scope`.

```yaml
applicable: true
status: no_change          # updated | no_change | blocked | outside_scope
reason: "Assessment found no eligible new durable learning beyond existing knowledge"
evidence: []               # references to assessed findings and relevant existing knowledge
files_changed: []          # completed writes only, including partial writes if blocked
checks:
  - status: not_applicable
    reason: "No knowledge writes were needed; no configured read-only checks apply"
remaining_work: []         # required, nonempty when blocked
```

All seven fields (`applicable`, `status`, `reason`, `evidence`, `files_changed`,
`checks`, `remaining_work`) are mandatory; lists may be empty only as their
conditions below allow. `reason` is mandatory and nonempty for every status. `applicable` is true for the
full workflow and partial scopes including knowledge management; it is false only
for an adoption scope without knowledge, which must use `outside_scope` and state
that adoption boundary in `reason`. An applicable assessment uses only `updated`,
`no_change`, or `blocked`; full workflow cannot claim `outside_scope`.

`updated` requires completed eligible, evidence-backed writes to the approved
configured system and passed applicable checks. Read relevant existing knowledge,
update or merge before creating redundant material, and preserve native mapping,
provenance, category protection, and approval safeguards. Record check results;
if no checks apply, explain that explicitly. `no_change` requires an actual
assessment with a reason such as duplicate, temporary, unsupported, code-obvious,
or otherwise no durable value. Empty writes alone do not establish assessment.
Missing approved paths, ambiguous write rules, failed writes, failed applicable
checks, unavailable required checks, or inability to assess required evidence are `blocked`, with the blocker
in `reason` and concrete `remaining_work`. Never invent destinations or report
blocked retention as `no_change`. Record completed partial writes separately;
they do not permit an `updated` outcome while required retention or checks remain.

Knowledge `checks` is a nonempty list of mappings with `status` and nonempty
`reason`. Allowed statuses are `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`, `not_run`, and
`not_applicable`. `passed` and `failed` also require the exact `command` and
supporting `evidence` references to retained output. Do not invent results.
`not_run` cannot satisfy an applicable required check; report the overall outcome
as `blocked` until it runs. `not_applicable` needs an explicit scope/configuration
reason; unavailability is not inapplicability. Check after the final topic,
metadata, navigation, and log write; an earlier check cannot certify a later write.
Mechanical success still requires substantive evidence/decision review. Keep
completed partial writes distinct from remaining work.

`native_discovery.status`, `unknown_conventions`, and `stop_block_reasons`
report discovery gaps without inventing a destination. `approval` records the
human decision that authorizes the approved Plan. `native_post_write_verification`
is required for every written native destination; every record has its own
`status` and canonical evidence fields. Its overall status is `verified` only
when every written destination has verified evidence. If any record is `unknown`
or `blocked`, the Run Summary must use that status, stop before additional target
writes, and must not claim that the destination was successfully recognized,
loaded, invoked, or enforced. Discovery or mapping with `unknown` or `blocked`
status also forbids `approval.decision: proceed` and target writes. All existing
Run Summary fields retain their prior meanings, including `reentry`, `retries`,
`parallel_groups`, `serialized_conflicts`, and `replan_reasons`.

`knowledge_outcome` is required and uses the Knowledge Outcome contract above.
Include completed writes in `knowledge_updates`, keeping it consistent with
`knowledge_outcome.files_changed`; partial completed writes may be listed for a
`blocked` outcome, with remaining work reported explicitly. An empty list is
valid with a reasoned `no_change`, a `blocked` outcome with no completed writes,
or an explicit `outside_scope` for partial adoption without knowledge. It never
proves assessment by itself. A blocked required knowledge outcome prevents the
Run Summary from claiming `status: completed`. Do not write run-specific learning
to this source repository's example knowledge tree by default.
